The **Campus Placement Prediction System** is a full-stack machine learning application designed to predict whether a student is likely to be placed during campus recruitment.

The project demonstrates the **complete machine learning lifecycle** — from dataset creation and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, retraining, and deployment — integrated with a modern **MERN stack architecture**.

The system follows a **three-tier microservice architecture** consisting of:
- a Python-based ML prediction service,
- a Node.js backend for data handling and storage,
- a React frontend for user interaction.
